# Thoth
Hermes-based Websocket Data Acquisition framework.

# Goal of the project

`thoth` aims to supply a single point of access for crypto-currency exchange data acquired via websockets. It makes use of `Hermes`, a zmq-base pub/sub framework and publishes data via a single proxy address, which can be subscribed to by an arbitrary number of subscribers.
